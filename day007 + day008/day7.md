Operators
Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.

Arithmetic operators
Operator	Operator Name	Example
+	Addition	15+7 = 22
-	Subtraction	15-7 = 8
*	Multiplication	5*7 = 35
**	Exponential	5**3 = 125
/	Division	5/3 = 1.66
%	Modulus	15%7 = 1
//	Floor Division	15//7 = 2
